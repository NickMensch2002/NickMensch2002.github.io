Session 3

Activity 2- Compare search engines.
Between all the search engines they all perform the same task, however they all perform them a bit differently. Starting off with the most popular search engine, Google. Google is the most versatile and crowdsourced platform, using search data and user analytics to create one of the most accurate search engines to date. 
Next up is Bing, owned by Microsoft. This search engine has always been the second choice and the one people use to download Google Chrome. This search engine, while close to being as accurate as Google, does not have the toolset as its big brother Google. 
Yahoo was a more content-based search engine, focusing on sub-categories such as news, weather, and stocks. This method showed a decline which led to the slow fall of those using Yahoo. 
Finally Ask, ask was a search engine that focused on people asking and answering questions. However as big giants such as Google and Bing came along, this needs to ask other people questions became outdated. 
With this new knowledge on search engines, I hope to use it in my field to get the knowledge I need to focus on my career such as figuring out answers to questions or helping myself learn more skills for my field.

Activity 5- Use the Internet Archive.
I have used the internet archive for multiple occasions. Authoring essays, researching topics, and other reasons. 
I have always advocated for the maintaining of the internet archive to preserve the history. 
I added one of my GitHub pages to the internet archive to preserve the history of my repository. 
With the internet archive I hope to be able to look back on the history of the internet and find out how far we have come in technology but also learn from it and use that past knowledge to help modern technology be created.
