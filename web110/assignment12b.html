Activity- Review Mozilla: What is accessibility
<br>
In my journey through Harper, I have homed in on preparing myself for a career path I am truly enthusiastic about: computer support and repair. 
It has been a concerted effort, focusing on courses that directly contribute to building the skill set essential for success in this field. 
From delving into the intricacies of computer science to mastering the nuances of JavaScript programming and troubleshooting techniques, each class has been a steppingstone towards my goal.

But it is not just about completing courses; it is about understanding the industry landscape and aligning myself with the demands of the job market. 
That is why I have been actively researching the job outlook for positions that match my skill set. 
What I have found is that most entry-level roles in computer support and repair are looking for candidates with certifications and, ideally, an associate degree.

Knowing this, I am reassured that the path I have chosen is indeed the right one. 
I am nearing completion of my associate degree, and with every course I finish, I feel more equipped and confident in my abilities. 
It is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is about applying it in real-world scenarios and demonstrating my capabilities to potential employers.

So, as I continue this journey, I am filled with a sense of excitement and determination. 
I know there will be challenges along the way, but I am prepared to face them head-on. With each step forward, I am getting closer to realizing my dream of a fulfilling career in computer support and repair.
