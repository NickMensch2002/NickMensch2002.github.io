<h1>Assignment Final - Summary</h1>
<p>

<br>
For my final project I did a lot more research on HTML and learned a lot more about it than I did initially. 
  Going over the topics again gave me a nice refresher. 
  Overall, I hope this video serves as a good learning experience for my peers as it was for me.
