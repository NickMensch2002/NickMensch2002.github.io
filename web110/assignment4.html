Session 4

Activity 3- Use an email client program.
For this task, I opted for Thunderbird as my email client. My familiarity with it stemmed from my Linux background, where it often came pre-installed with distributions like Ubuntu and Mint. 
As I navigated through Thunderbird's interface once more, it stirred up memories of past experiences. Moreover, it sparked ideas for potential applications in my professional field, like implementing it for various departments within an office complex. 
This use of Thunderbird not only facilitated my current task but also inspired future endeavors. Such as email lists but other needs that professional settings could use. Choosing Thunderbird for this task was intuitive given my Linux background. 
As I navigated its interface, memories emerged and sparked ideas for broader professional applications. 
Thunderbird's potential beyond email management, such as implementing email lists, accelerated my current task and hinted at future innovations.

Activity 2- Send, receive, and respond to email.
For this activity I started by writing a co-worker an email regarding a report we needed done by the end of the quarter. Then used my skills to attach some drafts of the report asking for some feedback. 
Then after receiving a reply from them, I replied with additional questions for feedback. 
Ending the email thread with a final draft of the report, sending it to my supervisor. Overall, it was a good refresher activity of my day to day life in a corporate environment.
