Session 5

Activity 2- Create a simple web page
    
Creating a basic login page using HTML has been an exciting learning experience for me. It's fascinating to see how text fields, login buttons, and password reset links come together to form a functional interface. I can already envision how these skills will be invaluable in a corporate environment. 
As I expand my knowledge, I'm eager to delve deeper into CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity. These additional layers will allow me to create more polished and user-friendly login pages. 
In a corporate setting, this proficiency will be crucial for enhancing existing web applications or collaborating on new projects. I can see myself troubleshooting login issues, refining authentication processes, and maybe even contributing to larger web development projects within a company. 
My understanding of HTML forms lays a solid foundation for further exploration into frameworks like React or Angular, which will empower me to build even more dynamic and sophisticated web applications. 
Overall, I'm excited about the possibilities that my newfound HTML skills bring, and I'm eager to continue honing them to become a valuable asset in the world of corporate web development.

Activity 3- Validate your web page 
I then went on to validate the webpage worked and it did log the credentials to a local text file on my machine which I coded to forward to validate it was capturing the details instead of blankly grabbing the details and doing nothing with them. 
This project was overall a success and I cannot wait to use it as a real world application.
