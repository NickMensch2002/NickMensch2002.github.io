Session 5

Activity- Review GCFLearnFree: Blog Basics. Research free traditional blogging sites and create a new blog. 
    
Using the guidance provided in the tutorial, I embarked on the journey of crafting a rudimentary blog on Tumblr. Though its impact remained somewhat limited, serving primarily as a stepping stone toward grasping the fundamentals of blogging, the experience proved invaluable. Delving into the intricacies of the platform also afforded me the opportunity to explore the myriad of blogs curated by fellow users.
The advent of blogs marked a significant technological leap forward, revolutionizing the way individuals interacted and shared information online. It facilitated the emergence of vibrant communities that had previously existed in the shadows, now flourishing in the digital limelight as more and more enthusiasts joined various blog groups.
Through the medium of blogging, formerly quiet niches found their voices amplified, fostering dialogue, collaboration, and a sense of belonging among like-minded individuals. This phenomenon not only democratized content creation but also facilitated the exchange of ideas on a scale previously unimaginable, enriching the online landscape immeasurably.

Activity- Complete the tutorial TutorialsPoint: Social Networking. Based on the information provided, decide which of the following social media sites interest you.
<br>
Out of all the social media outlets given I have to say WhatsApp has intrigued me the most. Mostly because of its competition with huge companies like Google and Appleâ€™s messaging platforms, Google messages and iMessage. While having a smaller following in the U.S it has a huge following in areas such as India, China, Korea, etc. 
This is because of their stricter governments limiting messaging usage. WhatsApp creates a platform that can overcome issues like this without breaking any foreign laws. 
I can definitely use this app in the future because it is also useful for small businesses and keeping in contact with clients without sharing your direct number.
