Activity- Practice web browser safety
Delving deeper into the realm of internet security has become a recent fascination of mine, leading me to meticulously fine-tune my privacy settings and fortify my digital defenses. 
In an era where safeguarding personal information is paramount, I've become increasingly discerning about the tools I use to navigate the online landscape.   
Opting for Firefox as my browser of choice has proven to be a strategic decision, thanks in large part to its array of advanced privacy features.
One standout feature of Firefox is its robust tracking protection, which effectively blocks invasive trackers from monitoring my online activities without my consent.
This not only enhances my privacy but also helps to streamline my browsing experience by reducing clutter and distractions.
Additionally, Firefox's comprehensive privacy settings empower me to customize my level of privacy according to my preferences, providing a level of flexibility that is unmatched by other browsers

Activity- Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test malware detection
<br>
When it comes to antivirus protection, I've opted for a lesser known yet highly effective solution called Webroot. 
Unlike traditional antivirus software that can weigh down system resources with bulky installations and constant updates, Webroot takes a refreshingly streamlined approach. 
As a cloud-based antivirus application, Webroot operates with remarkable efficiency, loading only the essential components needed to safeguard my system.
