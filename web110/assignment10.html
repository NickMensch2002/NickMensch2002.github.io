Session 10
<br>
<br>
Activity- Create and use vector graphics. 
<br>
 In the pursuit of completing assignment 10, my primary endeavor involved harnessing a specific activity to generate a vector representation. 
 This task necessitated the transformation of a PNG image into an SVG file, a process for which I relied upon Adobe tools. 
 The decision to convert rather than create the SVG from scratch stemmed from its significantly simpler nature, aligning with the efficiency required for the assignment. 
 Through this process, I not only fulfilled the assignment's requirements but also gained valuable experience in utilizing Adobe tools for graphic conversion tasks.

Moreover, this activity served as a practical lesson in integrating SVG files into HTML documents, a fundamental skill in modern web development. 
 By navigating through the steps of embedding SVGs, I deepened my understanding of HTML structure and the intricacies of incorporating vector graphics seamlessly into web pages. 
 Overall, the activity proved to be a multifaceted learning experience, bridging graphic design with web development and equipping me with a diverse skill set for future projects in both domains.

<br>
Activity- Add multimedia to a web page. 
<br>
In this task, I seamlessly integrated a video into my HTML site, building upon my prior experience with adding images. 
 The process was straightforward, with the main difference lying in managing file types. While adjusting to the specific requirements of video formats, such as codecs and compatibility, I applied familiar techniques to embed the element effectively. 
 This activity furthered my understanding of HTML fundamentals while expanding my ability to incorporate multimedia elements, enhancing the website's engagement and dynamism. Overall I enjoyed this activity.
