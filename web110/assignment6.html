Activity- Review IP address settings for your local network
Engaging in this activity has been incredibly enlightening as it has provided me with valuable insights into my current networking setup. 
One of the most notable discoveries is that I possess a dynamic or rolling IP address. This dynamic allocation of IP addresses ensures that websites are unable to consistently track my precise location, affording me a level of privacy and anonymity online.
Additionally, I've become aware of the presence of a changing hardware ID, which further enhances my digital security by preventing any single device from being consistently identified across different online interactions. 
Exploring these aspects of my network configuration has not only broadened my understanding of networking principles but has also underscored the importance of privacy and security in today's digital landscape. 
Moving forward, I intend to leverage this newfound knowledge within my field, utilizing it to assist others in optimizing their own network setups. 
Whether it's advising on privacy measures or implementing security protocols, I am equipped with valuable insights that can positively impact the online experiences of individuals and organizations alike.

Activity- Share a folder and connect to the shared folder:
<br>
When it comes to sharing folders, I was already pretty familiar with the concept because of previous jobs but it was nice to get a refresher. 
This activity gave me the knowledge to apply later on in my career to help share files with coworkers.
